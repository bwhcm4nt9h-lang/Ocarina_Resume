# Interactive Resume

An immersive single-page resume built with React and Vite. Explore experience, skills, and projects through animated sections and interactive controls.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app runs on <http://localhost:5173> by default. Hot module reloading will keep the page up to date as you edit the source.

## Production Build

To verify the production bundle compiles successfully:

```bash
npm run build
```

Serve the static build locally (optional):

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Deploying

The site is configured for static hosting. Deploy the contents of the `dist/` folder to your preferred provider (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).
